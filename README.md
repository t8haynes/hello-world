// test _ first GitHub repository
I am Lab Manager at Fab Lab ICC in Independence, Kansas, USA. I did not know much about Arduinos or programming before I started working here, but I am excited to begin learning how to program automated machines and robots, and developing a comprehensive IoT infrastructure at Fab Lab ICC.
